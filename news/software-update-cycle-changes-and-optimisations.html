            Hey everyone some minor changed will be done to the update cycle of the software releases of my desktop applications which will also further optimise it and remove unnecessary releases where they aren’t needed. 
           <p>
            Firstly the update/refresher cycle will be slowed down a little, for non DRM apps Youtube, Music Google Keep, Twitter etc will be extended to 3 months instead of monthly as it is a lot of work for one person to do and unnecessary to do a monthly release if the apps are running perfectly fine on the current version. DRM apps like streaming service apps will be 2 months to ensure that everything is working and nothing breaks especially for compiled applications for Windows.
           <p>
            AUR packages will now ignore the refresher updates as they are irreverent to the AUR packages which aren’t compiled and rely on LibElectron for everything, the refresher updates will only count towards compiled releases so the AUR packages will only follow main releases so please don’t mark my packages as out of date because they aren’t. LibElectron will continue a cycle update and switch to a 3 month cycle and follow with it’s versioning of dependencies.
           <p>
            Everything will continue moving along as it normally is and this will free up more time that isn’t needed and less updates for users when they aren’t necessarily needed. I will be rescheduling everything in my calendar accordingly to keep on track track of it all.
           <p>
            Oh and update regarding flatpaks since it has been requested on several apps, I am wanting to do that myself I just have  to figure out how to even do it but I won’t confirm a roadmap and promise anything for it until I can actually do it.
            <p>
            Cheers everyone!
           <p>
