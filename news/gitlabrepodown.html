            Sooo I have no idea what happened but last night my Gitlab repo randomly got blocked for no apparent reason.I have made a ticket for it and I really hope it gets resolved soon and I 
            don't lose my account as all my AUR packages resort to it and it has completely halted my development..
            <p></p>
            Here is a screenshot of what my account looks like now and I am honestly pretty devastated this has happened.

           So for now I will have to manually manage my website uploads, cannot upload any of my work and don't have access to any of my compiled binaries meaning all my bin packages are also affected so if you don't have any of my packages installed please don't mass report issues with my packages as I am well aware and if you do need them then I can compile and upload them to Archive.org or to my Github account. If the worse case scenario happens and I can't get this issue resolved then I will most likely move back to Github and update all my AUR packages.. It will be a lot of work to reupload all my projects and compile all the binaries I have don't again at the worse case scenario but I really hope for my sake as one person managing all of these repos and packages that it doesn't come to this.
