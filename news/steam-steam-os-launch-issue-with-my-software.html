          <div class="app-news-textbox-full">I have made a report to Valve on a Steam issue where electron apps in Linux will not properly execute, take ages to even start but will only flash open and can even stall or cause issues with Steam which will make it unresponsive after you launch the non steam apps.
           <p></p>
            I have a full git report on the issue <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/9131" target="_blank">here</a>
            <p></p>
            Hopefully this gets corrected soon as this renders all my software specifically for the Steam Deck unusable unless you are in desktop mode but on normal Linux distros you will just be unable to add it to Steam and launch from Steam and the big picture mode especially if you are in the beta branch using the new Steam big picture UI.

                Looks like some weird GPU stuff is happening, no idea what Steam is doing when launching it but whatever it is needs to be corrected as it break all electron apps and not just mine when added to Steam/Steam OS.
