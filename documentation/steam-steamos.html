                    Setting up the desktop apps on Steam/Steam OS is very easy, just follow this guide and you will be setup.
                  <p></p>
                    <h3>Step 1.</h3>
                  <p></p>
                    If you are on Steam OS make sure to switch to desktop mode, if you are on Linux than just ignore this first step. Go to <a href="https://coreybruce.netlify.app/software.html">Click here</a> and download the desktop app/s you are wanting to use by clicking the doownload button, this will direct you to the Gitlab download page. Make sure to download the Linux version and click the download button under Linux x64.
                  <p></p>
                    <h3>Step 2.</h3>
                  <p></p>
                    Once you have downloaded the app/s you wanted you will need to unzip the zip files, just unzip them to whereever you want to permanently keep them.
                  <p></p>
                    <h3>Step 3.</h3>
                  <p></p>
                   Now we are going to add them to Steam so they will show up in Steam or gamemode if you are on the Steam Deck, click on the add a game button at the bottom right of Steam and then click add non steam game

                  <div class="uinewsimagecont"><img src="https://coreybruce-assets.netlify.app/images/Screenshot from 2023-12-19 14-45-50.png" alt="Adding non steam application" width="100%" height="100%"></div> 
                 <div class="app-newsspacer2"></div>
                   Next click on Browse and look for the unzipped app folder, I will use Youtube for example which will be called Youtube-linux-x64, make sure to also change the menu on bottom rigth corner to all files and select the binary which will be what ever the application is called which for example with Youtube is just called "Youtube". If you are on Steam OS and new to Linux don't worry about my file mananager looking different as I am just on a different Linux distro.

                <div class="app-newsspacer2"></div> 
                  Once you have picked the binary Your Steam menu should look like this with the app selected, you can now press add selected program.

               <div class="app-newsspacer2"></div>
                  If you want to use the electron desktop apps on Steam/Steam OS you will need to add this launch option otherwise it won't work and Steam will think it's running, right click the app in the menu and go to the properties.

                <div class="app-newsspacer2"></div> 
                  Right click the app in the menu and go to the properties than add this launch option in the properties, once you have added that you are ready to use the app.
